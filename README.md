## Introduction of this course

<p>This course introduces the fundemental data structures and algorithms to its students to consturct time-optimized and memory optimizes software Applications</p>


 Chapter 1: Fundamentals introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.
 Chapter 2: Sorting considers several classic `sorting` algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.
 Chapter 3: Searching describes several classic `symbol-table implementations`, including binary search trees, redâ€“black trees, and hash tables.
 Chapter 4: Graphs surveys the most important `graph-processing problems`, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.
 Chapter 5: Strings investigates specialized algorithms for `string processing`, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.
 Chapter 6: Context highlights connections to `systems programming`, `scientific computing`, `commercial applications`, `operations research`, and `intractability`.
